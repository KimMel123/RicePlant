		<h1> Types of Rice Plant Disease <br><br></h1>
		<label> "Bacterial Leaf Blight"<br></label>
		<p> Bacterial leaf blight is prevalent in both irrigated and rainfed conditions particularly during the wet season. It may live in seeds, plant residues, perennial hosts, or in paddy soil and water and survive in infected rice stubble, in plant debris, or in soil if the host tissue is not decomposed. <br> <br></p>
		<h2> "Rice Blast" <br> </h2>
		<p> Blast, a fungal disease, is found in both upland and lowland environments and thrives on areas where water deficiency is prevalent, night humidity is high, and night temperature is low. <br> <br></p>
		<h3> "Rice Tungro" </h3>
		<p> Rice tungro disease is caused by the combination of two viruses (Rice tungro bacilliform virus/“RTBV” and rice tungro spherical virus/“RTSV”), which are transmitted by leafhoppers. <br> <br>  </p>

	<h1> Types of Rice Plant Disease <br> <br> </h1>
	<p> Bacterial Leaf Blight <br> <br> </p>
	<h2> Bacterial leaf blight is prevalent in both irrigated and rainfed conditions particularly during the wet season. Xanthomonas oryzae, a bacterium causes this disease. It may live in seeds, plant residues, perennial hosts, or in paddy soil and water and survive in infected rice stubble, in plant debris, or in soil if the host tissue is not decomposed. <br> <br> </h2>
	<h3> Rice Blast <br> <br></h3>
	<h4> Blast, a fungal disease, is found in both upland and lowland environments and thrives on areas where water deficiency is prevalent, night humidity is high, and night temperature is low. It is caused by Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus which can cause lesions. Blast occurs in all phases of the plant’s growth. <br> <br></h4>
	<h5> Rice Tungro <br> <br> </h5>
	<h5> Rice tungro disease is caused by the combination of two viruses (Rice tungro bacilliform virus/“RTBV” and rice tungro spherical virus/“RTSV”), which are transmitted by leafhoppers. It causes leaf discoloration, stunted growth, reduced tiller numbers and sterile or partly filled grains. Tungro infection can occur during all growth stages of the rice plant. It is most frequently seen during the vegetative phase. Plants are most vulnerable at tillering stage. </h5>-->
